Hey there!

I am Prahalathan Sundaramoorthy, a Master's student at the University of Southern California (USC). I currently live in the beautiful city of Los Angeles. I study and research machine learning along with its applications to ubiquitous computing. I also enjoy working with big-data through cluster-computing.

I am currently a research intern at HP Labs, Palo Alto, California, for the summer. I'm working at the intersection of time-series signal processing and machine learning. 

In my time away from coding, I deeply enjoy understanding the human brain through Philosophy. I also love listening to music, and playing Badminton. 

My favorite quote:
> _"As you sow, so shall you reap"_
