## HP Labs
### Research Intern							      
May 2020-Present, Palo Alto, United States

* Devised an end-to-end Heart Rate calculation model from Photoplethysmography (PPG) time-series sensor data in Python. Reduced mean error by 30% through spectral filtering and peak validation; collaborated with production team for porting model to **C** for release. 
* Achieved **80%** accuracy in predicting cognitive load of individuals through PPG wave morphology. Trained 1D Convolutional Neural Network to capture shape of data from 450 participants on AWS EC2.  
* Optimizing aforementioned models by integrating data from Inertial Measurement Units.

## Independent Research
August 2018-December 2018

* Developed ActiveHARNet, a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network capable of active learning to update model based on real-time unlabelled data for Human Activity Recognition.
* Trained model online and improved mean accuracy by ~25% using 50% incoming data. 

## Teknuance Info Solutions Pvt. Ltd
### NLP & Deep Learning intern
June 2018-August 2018, Chennai, India
* Examined deep learning techniques such as seq2seq LSTMs, Word2Vec, GloVe, etc. for performing NLP tasks -- text summarization, topic modeling on business data.

## Solarillion Foundation
### Research Assistant
April 2017-June 2018, Chennai, India

* Led a team of four to develop a Human Activity Recognition system from smartphone sensor data with 43 Million samples. Tested various CNN and RNN ensembles and designed HARNet. 
* Equipped HARNet with support for on-device incremental learning resulting in an increase in accuracy of ~35% of least performing end-user.
* Devised a low-cost system for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring on Raspberry Pi employing Ensemble Machine Learning (Extremely Randomized Trees) with inference time of 400ms and 86% accuracy.
